# Learning Open Source

Hi, I’m Riyashika Nedunchezhian 👋  
First-year Computer Science student passionate about building meaningful software.

This repository marks the beginning of my open-source journey.  
My goal is to understand how large systems are built, collaborate with others,
and contribute to impactful projects like Bitcoin.

Currently learning:
- Java & Data Structures
- Git & GitHub
- C++
- GPU Computing
- Linux fundamentals

I believe in learning deeply, contributing honestly, and creating value.
This is my first step into the open-source world.
